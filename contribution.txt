In the banking fraud detection project, my key contribution was the implementation of a robust machine learning pipeline aimed at accurately identifying fraudulent transactions. The process began with conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's features, which allowed us to categorize them into independent and dependent variables. Given the inherent imbalance in the dataset between fraudulent and legitimate transactions, I applied data balancing techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and under-sampling to ensure unbiased model training. Following data balancing, the dataset was split into training and testing sets to enable effective model evaluation.

Next, I explored various machine learning models that are well-suited for classification tasks. The models I implemented included Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Logistic Regression (LogReg), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each model was trained using the training data and rigorously evaluated based on multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provided a comprehensive understanding of each model’s ability to detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and negatives.

Among the evaluated models, the Decision Tree demonstrated remarkable accuracy and overall performance. Its interpretability and efficiency in handling various types of data made it the preferred choice for our fraud detection system. I fine-tuned the Decision Tree model to enhance its performance, ensuring that it maintained high accuracy on both training and testing datasets. Cross-validation techniques were employed to verify the model’s robustness and reliability.

To support the project, I documented the entire process thoroughly, including the rationale for each step, methods used, and outcomes. This documentation, combined with visualizations illustrating data distribution, feature importance, and model performance metrics, provided stakeholders with clear insights and facilitated informed decision-making. Ultimately, my contributions resulted in the development of a reliable Decision Tree model that effectively detects fraudulent transactions, thereby bolstering the bank's security measures.
